        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">I first joined the game jam through the P1 Games company. By the time I had joined P1 Games via LinkedIn, the game jam had already began. As a result, a majority of teams were already full. However, out of the teams still looking for programmers, Monster Health was one that originally peaked my interest. Primarily, because the original pitch, which is just a general introduction, given to me by the team leader envisioned a game more unique and off the beaten road. However, only a couple days upon joining, I became apparent that the project sounded so unique because, it turns out, nobody on the development team truly new what the game was. The game jam deadline was not too far off and movement, player models, controls, and even the gameplay loop itself was still incomplete. Despite these determents, I refused to just sit down and watch the disaster unfold over the rest of the game jam.</p>

        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">Over the next few days, I began voicing my opinions and critical feedback on the current state of development or lack there of. These were done in the frequent group meetings that the leader of the team conducted. Outside of speaking, I programmed what little was known to be of the game loop. Basically, this only included the movement. Knowing that the clock is ticking and we would need to have a finished product in, approximately, two weeks, I decided to make a great emphasis on going back to the basics. As in, actually making the game design document to completion. After a long meeting with me expressing my concerns with the team leader, I directly helped him create the final game design document with assistant of other developers. It is during this process that I also became the lead programmer of the team due to my knowledge on programming and proactive nature.&nbsp;</p>

        <h4 class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-3 align-center display-2"><strong>Programming the Game</strong></h4>
        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">By this point our team only had a bit more than a week left of development time before the game would need to be finished. Due to my new role as Lead Programmer, I assigned the smaller programming tasks to the other programmers who were unable to commit as much time as I could. In contrast, I would give myself a large portion of the programming work. This work included basic movement, infinite runner generation, procedural obstacles, moving obstacles, an entire text display system that included animated text with noise accompanied by custom pictures, and a win scenario. In order to accomplish these tasks, I had to set myself hard deadlines via a Trello board, as shown above, where I, and the team lead, made all of the jobs to be done and the deadlines to be met. Furthermore, at this time I had taken quite a break from the Unity Game Engine. As a result, I had to quickly learn the updated Unity Engine in both engine features and the C# language.</p>

        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">Luckily, the other programmers did find the time and effort to finish their tasks. Similarly, our artists were able to finish whatever designs they could before the submission date. The music was then one of the last features to be completed. The team lead would put everything together in the final project. In the end, the team was able to submit a complete game on the assigned deadline.
