                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">After the P1 Game Jam had finished, I decided to participate in the largest recurring game jam in the indie development space as a solo developer. This game jam was the 2024 GMTK Game Jam hosted by Game Maker’s Toolkit. The theme of the game jam, which was shown when it started, was “Built to Scale” and we, the contestant developers, were tasked with interpreting what it meant. Lastly, the game jam had a 48 hour deadline for submitting a project.</p>

        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">[image taken from "TerraTech" on Steam]<br>I wanted to take the idea of “Built to Scale” in a unique manner in order to stand out amongst the crowd. A defining trait of mine that I have constantly repeated throughout my indie development journey. My first inspiration came from my two favourite game genres, the sandbox genre and the space genre. As such, I wanted to see if I can incorporate sandbox elements with scale. After much contemplation, I settled upon an idea that was inspired by the relatively old game TerraTech. In that game, you played as a ground or air vehicle that would fight other AI vehicles for parts. I decided to put my own twist on this idea. I would have the player be a spaceship that would fight a series of enemies in a multitude of levels for thrusters, weapons, and the ability to make custom turrets made out of blocks. That last feature of custom turrets was something completely absent from TerraTech and would distinguish my product from my inspiration.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">With the general gameplay idea thought out, I began to work on the backend framework for the game. My first order of business was getting a 3D player-controlled orbit camera that would follow their ship. Following this would be the basic movement script that allowed for real-time changes, a feature which is needed to support the adding and subtracting of thruster blocks. The next issue at hand was the first major scripting challenge I faced, the voxel system.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        The voxel system needed to cover 7 main features, the ability to place voxels, the ability to remove voxels, voxels separating, per-voxel health, voxel destruction, per-block special abilities, sub-object support. To lay the groundwork of the system, I decided that voxels will have a transition phase where they stay where the mouse is until they are placed or let go. I called this the “transition phase”. For placement, the voxel will be placed based on a raycast from the mouse to the side of a voxel. From that raycast, it will get the voxel it hits and the normal of said hit. The voxel being placed will then be placed at the position of the hit voxel in addition to the normal multiplied by the voxel grid size. If there was no voxel for it to be placed upon, then it would simply separate from the rest of the craft at the position it was last in during the transition phase. The removing aspect of the voxel system was resolved via a raycast that would get the clicked voxel. Upon getting clicked, the voxel will then enter the transition phase to be replaced or dropped. To implement the separation feature of the voxels, the voxels were to be unparent from their respective parent object. Upon doing so, the voxels were naturally separated. The health for the voxels was done through the already attached voxel script. Different voxels, as in objects, would have their own individual health with their own respective set health. Upon hitting zero health, the voxel had a 50% chance to either be destroyed, as in deleted, or to be separated. Per-block special abilities were done via inheritance. The base voxel script was given functions that allowed inherited voxels the ability to have unique actions upon being placed. Due to the time constraint of the game jam, four special voxels were made. The first was a thrust block, second was a gun block, the third was a X turret rotator, and the last was a Y turret rotator. Speaking of turrets, this is where the sub-object support issue came into play. The turret rotators were special blocks that automatically rotated toward the mouse on their respective axis. The plan was to allow voxels, such as gun blocks, to be placed onto the turret blocks to allow for fully functioning turrets. In order to program this feature, I altered the placing system so that, upon placing, the voxel will be re-parented to a turret if it was placed upon a turret block or voxel connected to a turret

                        I decided to make the AI simple in order to fit within the game jam time constraints. The enemy AI would be ships that were built in a similar fashion to the player ship. The AI would have 2 modes, passive and active. In passive mode, the AI would simply stay at its spawned location to avoid the need of creating scouting positions. In active mode, the AI would automatically start firing all of its attached weapons, turn towards the player, and try to keep a maintained distance from the player. This transition would occur via a spherical area-3D which would trigger once the player is of a certain distance to an enemy or if a bullet were to enter said area-3D. The AI ships were created by me making them as a player and simply exporting them for ai usage. They were then given arbitrary movement and turns speeds based on balancing. Now, the AI is simple but not because of my skills. It was simple because of the last minute issues that took up a majority of my time.

                    <p class="mbr-text mb-4 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The turret system ended up being the Achilles’ heel of my project. Originally, I planned to have the rotation of the turret voxel be based on the normal given when placed. As in, the rotation axis would match the normal. However, complications with the “look_at” function given from Godot prevented that from happening. Even after switching to a mathematical single-axis rotation between two points approach, I was still facing issues on what the rotation axis should be. I attempted to solve this problem for about five to seven hours before deciding that time was too important and splitting the turret block into two locked axes. After this I got an incredible looking result with my being able to make both one-axis turrets on both axes and two-axis turrets. As a bonus, several of these turrets were able to be placed at once. However, tragedy struck when it came to the Godot physics engine. Whether it be the physics engine being known as a poor implementation or my method in which to control rotation, certain rotations during movement would bug out the player ship. At the same time, enemy ships seemingly broke upon having a turret attached with the turret only moving when I manually selected the enemy ship in the game engine window. For these reasons, I ended up having to scrap the turret system. This would be a gigantic blow to my project as I easily spent the majority of my production time on this feature.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        With a large part of my game now removed after hours of time spent, I was ever so close to the deadline. I quickly assembled my level system via gateways the player would have to go through. Similarly, I figured out the death mechanics which I decided was when the player’s core, which is the green voxel they spawn with, is destroyed then the player gets a death screen. I then made a bunch of floating text to act as a pseudo-tutorial for the player. Lastly, I filled the remaining levels with whatever enemies I had already created as there was too little time to make any more. By the end of the chaos, I submitted about 10 minutes before the deadline in the dead of night while being incredibly mentally exhausted. The game functioned fine with everything previously mentioned except for my time-consuming turret system. However, my last level did have a broken portal and my camera’s vertical axis control was inverted.

        <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text mb-4 display-7">Looking back on the project, I absolutely have lots to learn. For one, I need to figure out how my physics engine of choice functions in order to prevent last minute errors. I also need to better judge when a feature is destined to not meet a deadline. Similarly, I should take in better consideration on the scope of a project in relation to a deadline. For a 48 hour time limit, I was quite ambitious. Especially due to the fact I was so inexperienced with the physics engine I was using. However, despite my failures, I absolutely loved participating in the game jam. It has taught me so much about time management, deadlines, scripting, physics, and quick problem solving.
