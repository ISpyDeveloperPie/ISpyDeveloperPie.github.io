        <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text mb-4 display-7">
          My name is Logan Arroyo. I have yet to start working in a programming job at my age. However, I have taken small jobs as an indie game developer. Specifically, while in high school, I was a somewhat experienced game developer on the Roblox platform. There, not only did I release several games of my own, but I also was hired to work on other games. I was not paid directly in cash but in Roblox currency, Robux, which could then be converted into cash. Outside of programming, I also took up a hobby in 3D modeling for game development. This included fictional creations from imagination and recreations of real-world objects such as planes and ships. Towards the later parts of my junior and senior year of high school, I would leave the Roblox platform and dive into more in-depth game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and eventually Godot, which is currently my engine of choice. I now mainly learn C++ and Rust for Godot game development along with its language, GDScript. My love of game development and programming in general would lead me to pursue a BS in computer science at the California State University of Fullerton. In addition, I am also looking into specializing in the development of Artificial Intelligence. This, combined with game development, made me pursue knowledge in GPU programming via Nvidia's CUDA language.</p>

          <strong>In-Game 3D Editor</strong></h4>
        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">In-Game 3D Editor allowing for resizing, position, and rotation via 3D gizmos to create 3D spaceships. My editor also allowed placement of Constructed Solid Geometry (CSG) Objects which is a real-time method of creating 3D boolean operations. Furthermore, objects could be equipped with special properties using my GUI on the top-right. For instance, you could name the selected objects, mirror them, or change their CSG operations. As with CSG, there must be what is known as a CSG Tree for the booleans to work. Therefore, I implemented a custom tree, fully programmed by me, that allows users to use the GUi in the top-left to place CSGs under one another to make any kind of CSG Tree. The property panel would also allow for user-inputted exact values for position, scale, and rotation. At the top are two buttons which allow for scene changes depending if the user wants to edit the interior or exterior of their ship. Above that are values that the user can edit. These values are the increments that position, scale, and rotation. The three buttons arranged vertically on the top left allow the user to select which out of the three tools, position, scale, and rotation, to choose from. This was done in Godot with the C++ language.&nbsp;<br></p>

        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">Cyclic Coordinate Descent Inverse Kinematics (CCD IK) that allows for procedural animation. This allows for any amount of joints to start from a pivot point and rotate themselves to the goal object which is the green cube in this picture. The CCD algorithm also allowed me to implement rotational constraints. With CCD Inverse Kinematics, I could implement all kinds of appendages such as human legs, spider legs, arms, tentacles, and more and have the appendage interact dynamically with its environment. In other words, arms correctly reach for objects and legs correctly align themselves to walk on a surface. This was done in C++ in the Unigine game engine.<br></p>

          <strong>Game Engine Modification (Godot)</strong></h4>
        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7">
          If you are familiar with Godot, you may see something strange about the above picture. If you are not, then it should be known that the "propagate transform" button near the bottom of the image is not a standard button in the Godot engine. Instead, it is a button I programmed myself to be in the game engine. The "propagate transform" option allows any 3D object to determine whether or not to affect its 3D children's transforms, meaning position, rotation, and scale. In order for me to implement this option, I had to not only have a relatively deep understanding of C++ but also of reading the game engine's code. In this case, I had to learn how the game engine handled different in-engine features, game objects, updating transformations, and what it means to have a "dirty" variable. In the end, my modification was a success.
